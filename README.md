## ModeUserInterface
# Start here!
We are currently developing a model to simulate power and data consumption of LunaSats given different configurations of sensor modes. Ultimately this will be used by end users to experiment with different ways to collect data with their LunaSat.

This project is meant to be as configurable as possible. If you want to play around with your own configuration, go to think link and mess around
